# UserObjects for GH 1.0 ðŸ¦—
Grasshopper user objects are files you can add to Grasshopper to enhance and ease your workflow. Mostly they are clustered components. They will reside with the other components, which makes them easy to use.  
Everybody can create them by "File > Create User Objectâ€¦"

### [Multi Fillet](UserObjects/Multi%20Fillet.ghuser)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-legacy-lightgrey?style=flat-square)
_This is only here for compatibility reasons. Please have a look at the new [Multi Fillet AND Chamfer](#multi-fillet--chamfer) down below._

Actually a small [python script](assets/MultiFillet.py) which allows the user to input a curve, curve parameters (= where to fillet) and a radius. This works like the default 'Fillet' component in Grasshopper should work (instead it will generate a new curve for every `t` inputâ€¦).

### [Multi Fillet & Chamfer](UserObjects/Multi%20Fillet.ghuser)
This is an extended version of my previous Multi Fillet script/user-object.
You can now also chamfer your curves at the curve parameters you specify.

### [ShatterInt](UserObjects/ShatterInt.ghuser)
ShatterInt shatters multiple curves at their intersections.

### [Show All Plane Vectors](UserObjects/Show%20All%20Plane%20Vectors.ghuser)
Deconstructs a plane and outputs the basepoint and all the main vectors. Should be used together with the `Vector Display Ex (VDisEx)` component.
